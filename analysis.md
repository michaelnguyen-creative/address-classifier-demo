# Business Analysis & Algorithm Design Insights

## 1. Key Business Intelligence for Algorithm Design

### 1.1 Critical Success Factors from Domain Analysis

Based on the Vietnamese address domain knowledge, here are the **critical insights** that directly impact algorithm design:

#### **Geographic Hierarchy Constraints (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
```python
# This is your strongest validation tool
business_rule_1 = {
    "principle": "Geographic consistency trumps string similarity",
    "implementation": "Always validate district-in-province and ward-in-district",
    "example": "Even 90% string match is invalid if geography is wrong"
}
```

**Algorithm Implication**: Build **geographic constraint database first** - it's your strongest signal for disambiguation.

#### **Administrative Type Patterns (HIGH PRIORITY)**
```python
administrative_patterns = {
    "urban_pattern": {
        "province": ["TP.HCM", "Hà Nội", "Đà Nẵng"],
        "district": "Quận + [Number]",
        "ward": "Phường + [Number]",
        "confidence_boost": 0.2  # Higher confidence for pattern matches
    },
    "rural_pattern": {
        "district": "Huyện + [Name]", 
        "ward": "Xã + [Name]",
        "confidence_boost": 0.1
    }
}
```

**Algorithm Implication**: **Pattern recognition** can provide strong confidence signals and guide fuzzy matching.

### 1.2 Data Quality Assessment for Algorithm Strategy

#### **Reliability by Administrative Level**
| Level | Completeness | Name Uniqueness | OCR Error Rate | Algorithm Strategy |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Province** | 100% | Very High (63 unique) | Low | **Exact matching priority** |
| **District** | 98% | High | Medium | **Hierarchical + fuzzy** |
| **Ward** | 95% | Low (many duplicates) | High | **Context-dependent fuzzy** |

**Strategic Decision**: **Province-first approach** - most reliable identifier that constrains search space dramatically.

## 2. OCR Error Analysis & Algorithm Optimization

### 2.1 Error Pattern Frequency Analysis

Based on domain knowledge, here's the **business impact** of different error types:

```python
ocr_error_priorities = {
    "diacritic_loss": {
        "frequency": "Very High (80% of errors)",
        "impact": "Medium (still recognizable)",
        "solution": "Aggressive normalization + fuzzy matching",
        "algorithm_weight": "Primary focus"
    },
    "punctuation_spacing": {
        "frequency": "High (60% of errors)", 
        "impact": "Low (doesn't affect meaning)",
        "solution": "Preprocessing normalization",
        "algorithm_weight": "Easy wins"
    },
    "character_confusion": {
        "frequency": "Medium (30% of errors)",
        "impact": "High (changes meaning)",
        "solution": "Character similarity mapping + edit distance",
        "algorithm_weight": "Critical for accuracy"
    },
    "word_boundaries": {
        "frequency": "Low (15% of errors)",
        "impact": "Very High (breaks parsing)",
        "solution": "Pattern-based segmentation + recovery",
        "algorithm_weight": "Must handle robustly"
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Cost-Benefit Analysis for Algorithm Components

    "diacritic_removal": {
        "implementation_effort": "Low (1 day)",

        "roi_score": "Good"
    }
}
```

    "exact_lookups": {
        "implementation_effort": "Low (2 days)",

        "coverage": "~60% of cases",
        "roi_score": "Excellent - implement first"
    },

        "implementation_effort": "Medium (5 days)",
        "performance_impact": "Good (~5ms)",
        "coverage": "~30% of cases", 
        "roi_score": "Good - core algorithm"
    },
    "fuzzy_fallback": {
        "implementation_effort": "High (7 days)",
        "performance_impact": "Poor (~20ms without optimization)",
        "coverage": "~10% of cases",
        "roi_score": "Risky - optimize heavily or limit scope"
    }

2. **Accuracy threshold**: >85% overall accuracy on private test set
3. **Geographic validity**: 100% of results respect administrative hierarchy

#### **Secondary Success Criteria** (Differentiate quality solutions)
1. **Confidence calibration**: High-confidence predictions are actually more accurate
2. **Graceful degradation**: Meaningful partial results when complete match impossible
3. **Error transparency**: Clear indication of uncertainty and failure modes

#### **Tertiary Success Criteria** (Nice-to-have for excellent solution)
1. **Robustness**: Handles edge cases and unexpected input gracefully
2. **Maintainability**: Clean, documented code ready for production
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to update with new administrative changes

## 10. Implementation Roadmap with Business Checkpoints

### 10.1 Business Milestone Gates

Each week includes **business validation checkpoints** to ensure we're on track:

```python
business_checkpoints = {
    "day_3_checkpoint": {
        "business_question": "Is the normalization approach working?",
        "success_metric": "Manual testing shows >80% improvement on noisy samples",
        "failure_action": "Revise normalization strategy immediately"
    },
    
    "day_7_checkpoint": {
        "business_question": "Does basic algorithm meet minimum viability?",
