Perfect — let’s go with **Option A**: I’ll directly weave the refined corrections (with recent references) into your original document, so you end up with a clean, citation-supported text.

Here’s the **corrected + updated version** (executive summary + fixed paragraphs + inline citations).

# Executive Summary (Corrected, 2016–2025 evidence-based)

This review updates the theoretical foundations of a **rule-based Vietnamese address classification** system (non-ML) using recent results. Core conclusions:

* **Unicode normalization** (NFD/NFC) and **diacritic restoration** are essential preprocessing steps for Vietnamese OCR text. Neural diacritization (seq2seq, BiLSTM, TCN) achieves much higher restoration accuracy than rule-based approaches, significantly improving downstream matching  .
* **Compressed tries** (Patricia/radix, CoCo-trie) reduce memory from O(N×M) worst-case towards practical compactness while retaining O(|key|) lookup, making them suitable for large gazetteers  .
* **Bounded edit distance** with diagonal banding or Myers’ bit-parallel algorithm reduces runtime to O(k×|query|) per candidate for small k, with excellent real-world performance for k ≤ 2–3  .
* **Hierarchical constraints** (province→district→ward) are the single most effective pruning mechanism: reducing candidates from \~11,357 flat entities to \~143 per path (≈79× reduction). Real implementations of Vietnamese parsers confirm stronger pruning in practice  .
* **OCR performance** on Vietnamese: modern systems achieve high accuracy on clean text but still mis-handle diacritics and noisy scans. Post-OCR correction (reference-based or LLM-assisted) is recommended for degraded inputs  .

# Corrected Sections

### Boyer–Moore String Searching (Corrected)

* **Time Complexity**: Boyer–Moore achieves sublinear *average-case* complexity due to skipping heuristics. Naive variants can degrade to O(nm), but with Galil optimization and modern refinements, **worst-case complexity is O(n + m)**. Correct phrasing: **average-case sublinear; worst-case O(n + m)** .

---

### Vietnamese Diacritics (Clarified)

* Vietnamese uses base Latin letters plus Ă, Â, Ê, Ô, Ơ, Ư, Đ, each combined with one of six tone marks. Unicode provides many **precomposed glyphs** for these combinations (\~134 commonly encoded), but this number is an artifact of Unicode encoding, not a linguistic constant. For algorithms, apply NFC/NFD normalization and optionally diacritic restoration .

---

### Trie Space Complexity (Corrected)

* For N keys with average length M, a standard trie uses **O(N × M)** nodes in the worst case (one per character). The alphabet size affects branching but not the asymptotic bound. Memory depends heavily on representation; compressed tries (Patricia/radix) and **CoCo-trie** (data-aware compaction) drastically reduce footprint  .

---

### Hierarchical Search-Space Reduction (Nuanced)

* Vietnam has \~63 provinces, \~695 districts, and \~10,599 wards (≈11,357 entities). A flat gazetteer search must compare against all. Constraining search to valid province→district→ward paths reduces candidates to \~143 per branch, a crude reduction factor ≈ 79. In practice, pruning is stronger since invalid cross-province district/ward matches are eliminated  .

---

### Edit Distance Complexity (Corrected)

* Wagner–Fischer DP runs in O(mn) for strings of length m and n. With error bound k, **banded DP** reduces this to **O(k × min(m, n))**. Myers’ bit-parallel algorithm accelerates further, especially for small k (≤ machine word size, typically ≤ 63). Best practice: use bit-parallel or banded DP for k ≤ 2–3  .

---

### Vietnamese OCR Accuracy (Corrected)

* Recent surveys show high OCR accuracy on clean printed Vietnamese, but **diacritic and segmentation errors** dominate on noisy or historical texts. Reported accuracies vary across datasets and engines; no universal figure applies. Post-OCR correction (reference-based or LLM-assisted) is essential for difficult cases  .
