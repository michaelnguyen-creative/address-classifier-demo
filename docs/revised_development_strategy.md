**Strategy Summary**: 
- **80% effort** building bulletproof POC (Days 1-16)
- **20% effort** optimizing for competitive advantage (Days 17-21)  
- **Risk mitigation** through early requirement achievement
- **Competitive advantage** through deep algorithmic sophistication and domain expertise

**Key Insight**: Better to have an excellent algorithm running at 0.05s than a mediocre algorithm running at 0.005s. The POC-first approach ensures we build something that works exceptionally well, then optimize intelligently.
