# Excellent Question - You've Spotted a Key Design Decision

**Short answer**: Yes, the hash maps are **absolutely necessary** even with separate Tries. Let me explain why they serve fundamentally different purposes.

---

## **The Core Misunderstanding**

You're conflating two distinct operations:

### **1. Tries: FINDING entities in text**
```python
# What Tries do:
"ha noi nam tu liem cau dien" → search in trie → "Hà Nội"
```

### **2. Hash Maps: VALIDATING relationships between entities**
```python
# What Hash Maps do:
("Cầu Diễn", "Nam Từ Liêm", "Hà Nội") → validate → True/False
```

---

## **Why You Need Both**

Let's trace through a real example to see why:

### **Scenario**: Parse `"Tân Bình, Tân Bình, Hồ Chí Minh"`

**Step 1: Trie Matching (What you have)**
```python
ward_trie.search("tan binh") → "Tân Bình"
district_trie.search("tan binh") → "Tân Bình"
province_trie.search("ho chi minh") → "Hồ Chí Minh"
```

**Problem**: You now have 3 names, but you don't know **which** "Tân Bình" ward goes with **which** "Tân Bình" district!

Remember from your debug output:
```
Found 23 wards named 'Tân Bình'  ← Which one?!
Found 1 district named 'Tân Bình'
```

**Step 2: Hash Map Validation (The missing piece)**
```python
# Get all possible codes
ward_codes = ["06904", "10532", "13225", ..., "26839"]  # 23 possibilities!
district_codes = ["766"]  # Only 1 district
province_code = "79"

# Check which ward actually belongs to district 766
for ward_code in ward_codes:
    if ward_to_district[ward_code] == "766":  # ← NEED THIS MAP
        if district_to_province["766"] == "79":  # ← NEED THIS MAP
            return ward_code  # Found the right one!
```

Without the hash maps, you'd have **no way** to disambiguate the 23 wards!

---

## **What Tries CAN'T Do**

Tries can only answer: **"Is this string in my database?"**

Tries **cannot** answer:
- "Does this ward belong to this district?"
- "Does this district belong to this province?"
- "Are these three entities hierarchically consistent?"

---

## **The Data Structures Serve Different Purposes**

| Structure | Purpose | Question Answered |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Trie** | String matching | "Is 'ha noi' a province name?" |
| **name_to_code** | Entity lookup | "What are ALL codes for 'Tân Bình'?" |
| **code_to_parent** | Relationship | "Does ward X belong to district Y?" |

Think of it like a database:
- **Trie** = Full-text search index
- **Hash maps** = Foreign key constraints

---

## **Could You Theoretically Combine Them?**

You might think: "What if I store parent codes IN the Trie nodes?"

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end = False
        self.value = None
        self.codes = []  # Store ALL possible codes here?
        self.parent_codes = []  # Store parent relationships?
```

**Why this is a bad idea**:

1. **Violates separation of concerns** - Trie should only handle string matching
2. **Breaks the data model** - A single name maps to MULTIPLE entities with DIFFERENT parents
3. **Makes validation complex** - You'd still need to check parent relationships
4. **Harder to maintain** - Changes to hierarchy require rebuilding Tries

---

## **The Real Design Principle**

This is about the **Single Responsibility Principle**:

```
Trie: "I match strings efficiently"
Hash Maps: "I validate entity relationships"
```

Mixing them would create a **God Object** that tries to do too much, making your code brittle and hard to debug.

---

## **Proof: Try Removing Hash Maps**

Without `ward_to_district` and `district_to_province`, how would you implement this?

```python
def validate_hierarchy(ward_name, district_name, province_name):
    # You have the names, but how do you check if they're related?
    # You'd need to... build hash maps anyway!
    pass
```

The hash maps aren't optional - they're **the only way** to efficiently validate hierarchical relationships.

---

## **Summary**

The architecture is correct:
- **Trie**: Fast path for finding entities → O(m)
- **Hash maps**: Fast path for validating relationships → O(1)

Removing either would break the system. The multi-tier design needs both for different phases of the algorithm.
