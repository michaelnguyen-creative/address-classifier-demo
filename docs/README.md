 output before passing to Tier 2

**Key Points:**

### [ADR-003: Alias Precomputation vs. Runtime Fuzzy Matching](./ADR-003-Alias-Precomputation.md)

**Decision:** Precompute 7 aliases per entity and store in Trie, rather than compute fuzzy matching at runtime

**Key Points:**
- 1MB space cost is acceptable for 15x query speedup
- Bounded variant space (7 patterns) is deterministic and testable
- Hierarchical filtering makes runtime fuzzy matching unnecessary

**Read this if:** You want to understand the space/time trade-off for variant matching

## 🔬 Algorithm Analysis

### [Formal Complexity Analysis and Correctness Proofs](./Algorithm-Analysis.md)

**Contents:**
- Time/space complexity for each algorithm
- Proof of hierarchical consistency (never returns invalid hierarchy)
- Proof of no false negatives for exact matches
- Worst-case and average-case analysis
- Performance benchmarks

**Key Results:**
- Tier 1 (Trie): O(m) lookup, 80% coverage
- Tier 2 (LCS): O(n×m) with hierarchical filtering → O(100×n×m) effective
- Tier 3 (Edit Distance): O(k×m) with k=2 bound
- End-to-end: 4.69ms average, 95th percentile < 10ms

## 🔄 Decision Evolution

Understanding how decisions evolved over time:

### Phase 1: Initial Design (Pre-Documentation)

**Original approach:**
- Single LCS algorithm for everything
- Raw Tier 1 output passed to Tier 2
- Fixed confidence scores

**Problems identified:**
- Too slow for clean addresses
- Error propagation between tiers
- Confidence didn't reflect match quality

### Phase 2: Three-Tier Architecture (ADR-001)

**Changes:**
- Added Trie for fast path
- Added Edit Distance for typos
- Cascading with early termination

**Impact:**
- 10x speedup for common case
- 5% additional coverage from Tier 3

### Phase 3: Handoff Validation (ADR-002)

**Changes:**
- Added `_prepare_tier2_context()`
- Validation between tiers
- Adaptive confidence scoring

**Impact:**
- +8% accuracy on edge cases
- Eliminated false positives from bad anchors

### Phase 4: Alias Optimization (ADR-003)

**Changes:**
- Precompute 7 alias variants
- Store in Trie for O(m) lookup
- Add synonym support

**Impact:**
- Tier 1 coverage: 65% → 80%
- Average query time: 6.2ms → 4.69ms

## 🛠️ Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update ADRs

**Add new ADR when:**
- Making architectural decision affecting multiple components
- Choosing between significantly different approaches
- Decision has non-obvious trade-offs
- Future maintainers will ask "why did we do it this way?"

**Update existing ADR when:**
- Decision consequences change (new metrics)
- Alternative approaches discovered
- Implementation lessons learned
- Related code significantly refactored

## Context
[What problem are we solving? What constraints exist?]

## Decision
[What did we decide to do?]

## Rationale

## Consequences
[What are the positive and negative impacts?]

## Alternatives Considered
[What other approaches did we evaluate and why were they rejected?]
```

### Documenting Code Changes

When making significant code changes:

1. **Check if ADR needs update**
   - Does this change invalidate a decision?
   - Do we need a new ADR?

2. **Update complexity analysis**
   - Did time/space complexity change?
   - Update Algorithm-Analysis.md

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why so much documentation for a "simple" parser?

**A:** This system has non-obvious algorithmic trade-offs:
- Why 3 tiers instead of 1?
- Why precompute aliases instead of runtime matching?
- Why validate between tiers?

Documentation captures the **reasoning**, not just the **result**. Future maintainers will make better decisions understanding the "why."

### Q: Should I read all docs before contributing?

**A:** Depends on your task:
- **Bug fix:** Read relevant ADR section only
- **New feature:** Read all ADRs (1-2 hours)
- **Architecture change:** Read everything + discuss

### Q: How do I know if I need a new ADR?

**A:** Ask yourself:
- "Will someone ask why we did this in 6 months?" → Yes = Write ADR
- "Is this decision reversible easily?" → No = Write ADR
- "Are there trade-offs worth documenting?" → Yes = Write ADR

### Q: What if reality diverges from ADRs?

**A:** ADRs are living documents:
1. Update ADR with new reality
2. Add "Lessons Learned" section
3. Update status if decision superseded
4. Document **why** reality diverged

### Q: How do I cite these docs in code?

**A:** Use comments:
```python
def _prepare_tier2_context(self, trie_result):
    """
    Validate Tier 1 output before passing to Tier 2
    
    See: Docs/ADR-002-Tier-Handoff-Logic.md
    Rationale: Prevents error propagation from invalid matches
    """
```
