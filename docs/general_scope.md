## 🎯 **Requirements Analysis: Vietnamese Address Classifier**
- Audience: General (Non-Technical)

### **🔍 What We're Building**
Imagine you have a stack of Vietnamese ID cards that were scanned by a computer, but the text came out messy and unclear. Our system will read that messy text and organize it into clean, structured information like "Province: Nghệ An, District: Đô Lương, Ward: Thịnh Sơn."

### **💼 Business Problem**
**The Challenge**: Vietnamese addresses from scanned documents are often:
- Misspelled or have missing accent marks
- Have weird spacing or formatting
- Mix abbreviations with full names
- Sometimes have parts missing entirely

**The Goal**: Create a smart system that can understand these messy addresses and organize them properly, very quickly (faster than you can blink!).

### **🎯 Success Criteria (What "Good" Looks Like)**
- **Speed**: Must process each address in under 0.1 seconds (failure = 0 points)
- **Accuracy**: Should get 85%+ of addresses correct
- **Reliability**: Same input always gives same output
- **Coverage**: Even when parts are missing, give useful partial results

### **📊 Project Constraints & Context**
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks total (competition deadline)
- **Team**: Start solo, can grow to 5 people maximum
- **Rules**: No "smart AI" allowed - must use traditional programming only
- **Environment**: Will run on basic laptop (single-core processor)

### **🚀 Expected Outcomes**
1. **Week 1**: Basic working system (70% accuracy)
2. **Week 2**: Meets all requirements (85%+ accuracy, fast enough)
3. **Week 3**: Polished, competitive solution (90%+ accuracy)
